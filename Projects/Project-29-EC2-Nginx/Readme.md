# Project 29: Linux EC2 Configuration & Nginx Deployment

## Project Overview
Deployed and configured a Linux EC2 instance on AWS, managed user permissions, and installed an Nginx web server to practice core Linux administration skills.

## Skills Used
- **User Management:** Created users/groups and managed `sudo` privileges.
- **Service Management:** Installed, started, and verified the `nginx` service.
- **Log Analysis:** Investigated `/var/log/auth.log` and `journalctl` for system events.
- **File Permissions:** Applied `chmod` and `chown` to secure application directories.
