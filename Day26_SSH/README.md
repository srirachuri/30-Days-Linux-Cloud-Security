# 🔐 Day 26 — SSH Basics (Cloud & Security Core)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project covers **SSH (Secure Shell)** fundamentals — one of the most important skills for Cloud, Linux, and Security Engineers.

SSH is used daily to:
- Access cloud servers (AWS / Azure / GCP)
- Fix production issues
- Investigate logs
- Restart services
- Secure remote access using cryptography

This day focuses on **safe local practice (localhost)** and **key-based authentication**, which is the industry standard.
