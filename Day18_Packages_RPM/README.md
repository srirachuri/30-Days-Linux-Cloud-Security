# Day 18: RedHat Package Management (Yum/Dnf) 🎩

## 🎯 Goal
Understand the differences between Debian (`apt`) and RedHat (`yum`/`dnf`) package managers, which is common in Enterprise Linux (RHEL/CentOS).

## 🧩 Commands Learned
| Command (RHEL) | Purpose | Ubuntu Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `yum install` | Install | `apt install` |
| `dnf update` | Update | `apt upgrade` |
| `rpm -ivh` | Install File | `dpkg -i` |

## 🛠️ Learning Session
Since I am using Ubuntu, I reviewed the syntax differences to ensure readiness for environments using Amazon Linux or CentOS.
