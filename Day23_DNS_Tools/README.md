# 🌍 Day 23 — DNS Tools & Port Scanning (Cloud + Security Core)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **DNS troubleshooting, network path analysis, and safe port scanning** — all of which are **core daily responsibilities** for Cloud and Security Engineers.

DNS acts as the **Internet’s phonebook**, translating domain names into IP addresses.  
When a website or application is slow or unavailable, engineers first check:
- DNS resolution
- Network routing path
- Open or blocked ports

All activities in this project are **read-only, ethical, and non-destructive**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of Day 23, I am able to:
- Trace the network path packets take to reach a server
- Inspect DNS records (A, MX, NS)
- Resolve domains to IP addresses manually
- Perform **safe and ethical port scanning** using Nmap
- Explain DNS and port scanning clearly in interviews
