# 🌍 Day 27 — Hands-On: Remote Troubleshooting  
(SSH + Logs + Services + Permissions)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates **real-world remote troubleshooting** performed by Cloud, Linux, and Security Engineers.

A common production scenario:
> “Users report the server is slow or the application is not working.”

The engineer must:
- SSH into the server
- Investigate logs
- Restart a failed service
- Identify and fix permission issues
- Restore normal operation

All actions are performed **locally using localhost** — safe, ethical, and realistic.
