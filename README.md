# 30-Days-Linux-Cloud-Security

## About
This repository documents my **30 days of hands-on Linux practice**, focused on building strong fundamentals required for **Cloud and Linux Security roles**.

The goal of this project is to move beyond theory and gain practical experience with real-world Linux tasks such as system administration, permissions, services, logs, networking, and troubleshooting.

## What I Practiced
Throughout these 30 days, I worked on:

- Core Linux commands and filesystem navigation
- File and directory permissions (chmod, chown, umask, sticky bit)
- User and group management
- Process and service management using `systemctl`
- Package management (APT, YUM/DNF)
- Log monitoring and log rotation
- Networking basics and DNS tools
- SSH access and remote troubleshooting
- Real-world cloud and security-related scenarios
