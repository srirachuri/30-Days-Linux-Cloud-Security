# Day 17: Package Management (APT) 📦

## 🎯 Goal
Learn how to install, update, and remove software packages in Debian-based systems (Ubuntu).

## 🧩 Commands Learned
| Command | Purpose | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `apt update` | Refresh Repos | Updates package list |
| `apt install` | Install Tool | `sudo apt install git` |
| `apt remove` | Uninstall | `sudo apt remove git` |
| `dpkg -i` | Manual Install | Install `.deb` file |

## 🛠️ Practice Session
I performed a system update and installed a new tool (e.g., `tree` or `nmap`) to test the package manager.
