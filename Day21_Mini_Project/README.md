# 🌟 Day 21 — Mini Project: Compressed Backup using `tar`

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini project demonstrates how Linux, Cloud, and Security Engineers create **compressed backups** of critical server data before:
- Server updates
- Migrations
- Incident handling
- Maintenance windows

A proper backup can **save the server — and your job** if something goes wrong.
