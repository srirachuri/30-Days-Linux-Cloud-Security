# 🌍 Day 24 — Log Monitoring (Linux + Cloud Security)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **log monitoring and investigation**, a core responsibility of Linux, Cloud, and Security Engineers.

Logs are the **first source of truth** during:
- Security incidents
- Login failures
- Service crashes
- System reboots
- Cloud VM troubleshooting (AWS / Azure / GCP)

If logs don’t exist → **no investigation is possible**.
