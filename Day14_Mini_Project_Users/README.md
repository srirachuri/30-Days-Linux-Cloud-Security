# Day 14: Mini Project - User Isolation 🚧

## 🎯 Goal
[cite_start]Combine user management and permissions to create a secure, multi-user environment[cite: 9202].

## 🏆 Mini Project 14: Admin vs. Standard User
**Scenario:** Setting up a system with a privileged Admin and a restricted Standard User.

**Steps Taken:**
1. [cite_start]Created two users: `admin_user` and `std_user`[cite: 9202].
2. Created a strictly restricted file `top_secret.txt`.
3. Set permissions so only `admin_user` could read/write it.
4. [cite_start]**Verification:** Logged in as `std_user` and confirmed access was **denied**[cite: 9202].
