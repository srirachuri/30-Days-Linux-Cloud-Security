# Day 15: Linux Process Management ⚙️

## 🎯 Goal
Learn to monitor, manage, and kill system processes using `ps`, `top`, and `kill`.

## 🧩 Commands Learned
| Command | Purpose | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ps aux` | List Processes | Snapshot of all processes |
| `top` / `htop` | Real-time Monitor | Task manager view |
| `kill` | Terminate | `kill -9 <PID>` |
| `bg` / `fg` | Background/Foreground | Manage job control |

## 🛠️ Practice Session
I started a long-running process (`sleep 1000`) and practiced:
1. Sending it to the background (`bg`).
2. Bringing it to the foreground (`fg`).
3. Identifying its PID using `ps`.
4. Terminating it using `kill`.
